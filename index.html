          <p>
            It’s easy to forget to water your plants, but it doesn’t have to be.
            Happy Plant reminds you to water plants through game-like
            notifications, plant-selfies, and time-lapse videos so you can watch
            your Happy Plants grow baby grow.

            Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing
            that comes to your mind. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My
            pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. You do? Yeah,
            it's 8:00. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here.
            Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?

            Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
            Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to
            seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man
            has gone before. Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but
            it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to
            ensure the survival of the human species.
